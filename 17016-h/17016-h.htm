<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The principal purpose of this book is to give in brief
form the rules and usages governing the division of
words when the measure will not permit ending the word
and the line together. This matter is considered in its
relation to good spacing and to the legibility of the printed
page.</p>

<p>Leading up to the discussion will be found some consideration
of spelling, the formation of syllables, pronunciation,
and accent. This consideration is necessarily
brief, and no attempt has been made to give the rules for
spelling which are so frequently found in spelling books,
or any of them. In the writer's opinion such rules are of
very little practical value. Good spelling is not so much
the result of remembering and applying rules as it is of
observation, practice, and memory. The lists of certain
types of troublesome words may be found useful for ready
reference.</p>

<p>Syllable formation, pronunciation, and accent are considered
because it is hoped that the volumes of this series,
particularly those in Part VI (Correct Literary Composition)
and Part VIII (History of Printing), will contribute
something to the general education of the apprentice as
well as to his skill in the trade.</p>

<h2>DIVISION OF WORDS</h2>


<p>The division of words when the words do not exactly
fit the register of the line has always been a source
of trouble. In the days of the manuscript makers devices
such as crowding letters, reducing their size, or omitting
them altogether were freely used and words were arbitrarily
divided when the scribes so desired. During the greater
part of the time every scribe divided as he pleased, often in
ways which seem very strange to us, like the Greek custom
of dividing always after a vowel and even dividing words
of one syllable. With the invention of printing, however,
the number of these devices was greatly diminished. It
became a matter of spacing out the line or dividing the
word. Of course that meant frequent word division and
called for a systematization of rules with regard to this
division. These rules for division are necessarily based on
spelling and syllabication.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="SPELLING" id="SPELLING"></a>SPELLING</h2>


<p>The idea that there is one right way to combine the
letters representing a certain sound or group of sounds,
that is a word, and that all other ways are wrong and little
short of shameful is a comparatively new idea among us.
The English speaking folk held down to a comparatively
recent time that any group of letters which approximately
represented the sound was amply sufficient as a symbol of
the word. This sort of phonetic spelling was commonly
followed, and followed with great freedom. No obligation
was recognized to be consistent. In ordinary writing, such
as letters and the like, it is not unusual to find the same
word spelled in a variety of ways in the same document.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>The last century has brought about an attempt to standardize
spelling into conventional forms any departure from
which is regarded as highly derogatory to the writer. In
many cases these forms are fixed arbitrarily, and in
some there is even now disagreement among the highest
authorities. These difficulties and disagreements have
two reasons: First, English is a composite language,
drawn from many sources and at many periods; hence
purely philological and etymological influences intervene,
sometimes with marked results, while there is a difference
of opinion as to how far these influences ought to prevail.
Second, the English language uses an alphabet which fits
it very badly. Many letters have to do duty for the expression
of several sounds, and sometimes several of them have
nearly or quite the same sound. For example, there are a
number of distinct sounds of <i>a</i>, <i>i</i>, and <i>o</i> while <i>g</i> is sometimes
indistinguishable from <i>j</i> and <i>c</i> from <i>k</i>. This is not
always a matter of modification of sounds by the sounds of
other letters combined with them. One has to learn how
to pronounce <i>cough</i>, <i>dough</i>, <i>enough</i>, and <i>plough</i>, the <i>ough</i>
having four distinct sounds in these four words. Each one
of these sounds, by the way, could be exactly as well represented
by another combination of letters which would
be unmistakable, viz., <i>coff</i>, <i>doe</i>, <i>enuff</i>, and <i>plow</i>. It is
impossible to tell except by the context either the pronunciation
or the meaning of <i>bow</i>. If the <i>ow</i> is pronounced
as in <i>low</i>, it means a weapon. If the <i>ow</i> is pronounced as
in <i>cow</i> it may mean either an obeisance or the front end of
a boat.</p>

<p>This standardization of spelling is unfortunately not
quite complete, although nearly so. Concerning the vast
majority of the words in the English language there is no
difference of opinion. A few words are differently spelled
by different authorities. There are seven of these authorities
of the first rank, three English, Stormonth, the
Imperial Dictionary, and the Oxford Dictionary; and four
American, Webster's International, Worcester, the Century
Dictionary, and the Standard Dictionary. American
printers may ordinarily disregard the English authorities.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>Any one of the four American authorities may be safely
followed. In cases where two spellings are given in the
dictionary consulted, take the first one. Ordinarily a printing
office adopts one of the great authorities as a standard
and conforms the office style to it. All office copy will
follow it and all errors in copy from outside will be corrected
by it. Spellings differing from it will be regarded
as errors, even though supported by other authorities.</p>

<p>This rule, however, is subject to one very important
exception. The author has an unquestionable right to
choose his own dictionary or to use any spelling for which
there is any authority, English or American. If he has his
own ideas on the subject of spelling he should be very
careful that his manuscript is correctly spelled according to
his ideas, and clearly written or typed. He should also
indicate on the manuscript the authority he wishes used in
correcting the spelling in case of mistakes or illegible passages.
Every care should be taken to make the manuscript
copy as correct as possible and as legible as possible.
Such care may be very troublesome at first, but it will
result in great saving of expense.</p>

<p>In addition to the authorities named there are the rules
and &#8220;reformed&#8221; spellings adopted by the American Philological
Association and published by the United States
Government. These are followed fully in some offices,
partly in others, and in many not at all. This is a question
of the office style and the author's wish. If copy is clear
and spelled according to any authority, it is the compositor's
duty to follow it. If it is misspelled or illegible he is
to correct it according to the office style unless otherwise
directed by the author in writing. If furnished with such
a direction he is to follow it. This procedure will clear
the compositor of all blame. Any questions which then
arise lie between the author and the proofreader.</p>

<p>In the case of the reformed spellings, however, the
departure from the ordinary appearance of the words is
so great that the author cannot be allowed full freedom to
set aside the office style. If he is paying for the printing
he may insist on his spelling. If he is contributing to a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>periodical and the printing is done at the publisher's expense
it is for the publisher to determine the style of printing
to be used.</p>

<p>Any full consideration of the question of reformed spelling
is hardly in place in this book. The author may perhaps
be permitted one observation. Innovation in the use
of the English language would appear to be primarily the
work of scholars, and the adoption of such innovations
would seem to belong to the book printer rather than to
the commercial printer. The public mind as a whole is
conservative. It is not hospitable to changes and does
not soon become aware of them, much less familiar
with them. The commercial printer makes his appeal to
the mind of the general public. He will do well to use a
vehicle familiar, intelligible, and acceptable to it.</p>

<p>Correct spelling is mainly a matter of habit and observation.
To a certain extent it is a matter of careful pronunciation,
but this is not always a safe or even a possible guide.
The vowels preceding or following the one on which the
primary accent falls, sometimes called obscure vowels, are
so slurringly pronounced that even a pedantic precision will
hardly make it possible to indicate clearly which vowel is
used. The writer remembers seeing an examination paper
written by a fourth year medical student in which the word
<i>fever</i> was spelled <i>fevor</i>. A moment's thought will show
that so far as pronunciation is concerned the word might
be spelled <i>fevar</i>, <i>fevir</i>, <i>fevor</i>, <i>fever</i>, or <i>fevur</i> without any
appreciable difference. The correct spelling is merely a
matter of observation.</p>

<p>The author has on his desk at the moment of writing
these lines half a dozen good books, each containing a set
of rules for spelling. From these it would be easy to compile
a set of fairly good rules. Each of these rules, however,
has exceptions, in some cases quite numerous. To
remember these rules with their exceptions would be a
considerable mental task and to apply them would be cumbrous
and time consuming. The effort would probably
resolve itself into an actual learning of the words which
present difficulties. The best way to become a good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>speller is to form the habit of careful reading, observing
the form of every word as it passes before the eye and so
unconsciously fixing it in the memory. The dictionary
should be consulted whenever there is any doubt.</p>

<p>If you are to write a word, call up a mental picture of
it, and if the picture is not perfectly clear go to the dictionary
and fix a correct image of it in your mind. Be careful
to pronounce every word you use as correctly as possible
and you will get all the aid pronunciation can give you.
Careless speaking and careless reading are the two great
sources of incorrect spelling.</p>

<p>The following tables will be found useful in settling
practice with regard to certain troublesome classes of words.</p>

<p>The instructor should drill the pupils in spelling not only
these &#8220;catch&#8221; words, but a wide range of English words.
These lessons may be taken to advantage from some of the
books mentioned in the list for supplementary reading,
from any other good spelling book, or even from the pages
of any well printed book or magazine. The words should
be given out orally and written down by the pupil. A good
exercise is the reading of a paragraph from any good book,
or some stanza of poetry, the passage read to be taken
down by the pupil with care to spell, punctuate, and
capitalize properly.</p>

<p>A number of topics sometimes treated under the head
of spelling will be found discussed in the &#8220;Printer's Manual
of Style&#8221; (No. 41).</p>

<h2><a name="PRONUNCIATION" id="PRONUNCIATION"></a>PRONUNCIATION</h2>


<p>The English language is a difficult one to pronounce as
well as to spell. This arises from two causes. The
English language has some sounds not generally found in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>other languages, such as <i>w</i> and <i>th</i>. As has already been
pointed out, the alphabet fits the language very badly.
Careful lexicographers indicate no less than seven sounds
of <i>a</i>, five of <i>e</i>, three of <i>i</i>, four of <i>o</i> and six of <i>u</i>, as shown
in the following table:</p>

<p class="words">
&#257; as in &#257;le<br />
[Ia] as in sen[Ia]te<br />
&#259; as in &#259;m<br />
&aacute; as in &aacute;sk<br />
[a:] as in [a:]ll<br />
&auml; as in f&auml;ther<br />
(a) as in fin(a)l<br />
<br />
&#275; as in &#275;ve<br />
&#277; as in &#277;nd<br />
[Ie] as in ev[Ie]nt<br />
&#7869; as in f&#7869;rn<br />
(e) as in prud(e)nce<br />
<br />
&#299; as in &#299;ce<br />
[Ii] as in [Ii]dea<br />
&#301; as in p&#301;n<br />
<br />
&#333; as in &#333;ld<br />
[Io] as in [Io]pen<br />
&#335; as in &#335;dd<br />
&ocirc; as in &ocirc;rb<br />
<br />
&#363; as in &#363;se<br />
[Iu] as in [Iu]nite<br />
&#365; as in &#365;p<br />
[u:] as in r[u:]de<br />
[u=] as in f[u=]ll<br />
&ucirc; as in &ucirc;rn<br />
</p>

<p>In addition to these there are diphthongs, combinations of
vowel sounds pronounced as one syllable, such as</p>

<p class="words">
<i>ou</i> as in <i>out</i><br />
<i>oi</i> as in <i>oil</i><br />
</p>

<p>There are also a number of digraphs or combinations of
vowels or consonants which have but one sound, such as</p>

<p class="words">
<i>ai</i> as in <i>rain</i><br />
<i>eo</i> as in <i>people</i><br />
<i>ou</i> as in <i>soup</i><br />
<i>ou</i> as in <i>soul</i><br />
<i>ph</i> as in <i>phalanx</i><br />
<i>ch</i> as in <i>chorus</i> or <i>chair</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>C</i> has two sounds, hard before <i>a</i>, <i>o</i>, and <i>u</i>, as in <i>cat</i>, <i>cot</i>,
and <i>cut</i>, and soft before <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, and <i>y</i>, as in <i>cell</i>, <i>city</i>, and <i>cycle</i>.</p>

<p><i>G</i> has two sounds, hard before <i>a</i>, <i>o</i>, and <i>u</i>, as in <i>gate</i>,
<i>gone</i>, and <i>gun</i>, soft before <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, and <i>y</i>, as in <i>gem</i>, <i>gin</i>, and
<i>gyve</i>, although it is sometimes hard before <i>i</i> as in <i>girl</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ch</i> is sometimes soft as in <i>chair</i> and <i>arch</i>, and sometimes
hard as in <i>choir</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span><i>Th</i> has two sounds, soft, or surd, as in <i>thin</i> and <i>death</i>,
and hard, or sonant, as in <i>then</i> and <i>smooth</i>.</p>

<p><i>S</i> has two sounds, soft, or surd, as in <i>soft</i> and <i>this</i>, and
hard, or sonant, as in <i>has</i> and <i>wise</i>.</p>

<p>We have, therefore, twenty-six letters with which to
express fifty or more sounds, not counting the digraphs
and diphthongs.</p>

<p>Correct pronunciation depends upon three things, correct
sounding of the letters, correct division into syllables,
and correct placing of the accent.</p>

<p>A syllable is the smallest separately articulated, or pronounced,
element in speech, or one of the parts into which
speech is broken. It consists of a vowel alone or accompanied
by one or more consonants and separated by them,
or by a pause, from a preceding or following vowel. This
division of words into syllables is indicated in dictionaries
by the use of the hyphen thus: <i>sub-trac-tion</i>, <i>co-or-din-ate</i>.
It will be observed that in the first of these examples the
vowels are all separated by consonants, while in the second
two of them are separated by a pause only.</p>

<p>The English language has the further peculiarity of
using <i>l</i> and <i>n</i> as vowels in syllabication, as in <i>middle</i>
(<i>mid-dl</i>) and <i>reck-on</i> (<i>reck-n</i>).</p>

<div class="sidenote">
<p>The illustrations from this point to the end of this section on <a href="#Page_16">page 16</a> are not typographic
divisions. They concern pronunciation only.</p>
</div>

<p>The division of words into syllables for pronunciation
is generally, but not always, the same as that which
should be followed in case the word has to be divided
typographically. As these text-books are intended to help
the apprentice as a speaker and writer of English as well as
a printer, it is worth while to give some attention to syllabication
for pronunciation before proceeding to discuss
typographical division.</p>

<p>Two letters forming a diphthong or digraph are not to be
separated. <i>Coin-age</i> (<i>oi</i> diphthong) but <i>co-in-ci-dence</i> (<i>oi</i>
not a diphthong). <i>Excess</i> (<i>ss</i> digraph, pronounced practically
like a single s) gives <i>ex-cess-es</i>, <i>ex-cess-ive</i>, etc.
Whether or not the letters thus occurring together form
a diphthong or digraph will depend on the derivation of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>the word, thus in <i>cat-head</i> (verb), a nautical term, <i>th</i> is not
a digraph but in <i>ca-the-dral</i> <i>th</i> is a digraph, as is usually the
case with these two letters. You would not say <i>cat-hed-ral</i>.</p>

<p>Two vowels, or a vowel and a diphthong, coming
together but sounded separately belong to separate syllables.</p>

<p><i>A-or-ta</i>, <i>co-op-er-ate</i>, but <i>coop-er-age</i>, <i>moi-e-ty</i>.</p>

<p>Do not end a syllable with</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>a</i>) <i>c</i> or <i>g</i> when soft, <i>en-ti-cing</i>, but <i>dic-tion</i>, <i>wa-ges</i>
but <i>wag-on</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>t</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>sc</i>, <i>g</i>, and <i>d</i>, when followed by <i>i</i> or <i>e</i>
giving the sound of <i>sh</i>; <i>ra-tion-al</i>, <i>o-cean</i>, <i>re-gion</i>,
<i>as-cen-sion</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>d</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, and <i>z</i> when followed by <i>u</i> giving the
sound of <i>ch</i>, <i>sh</i>, <i>zh</i>, or <i>j</i>, <i>cen-sure</i>, <i>sei-zure</i>, <i>na-ture</i>,
<i>ver-dure</i>.</p></div>

<p>Do not begin a syllable with</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>a</i>) <i>x</i> with the sound of <i>ks</i> or <i>gs</i>, <i>anx-ious</i>, <i>ex-act-ly</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>r</i> preceded by <i>a</i> or <i>e</i>; <i>par-ent</i>, <i>av-er-age</i>, but by
exception, <i>pa-rent-al</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Single <i>l</i>, <i>n</i>, or <i>v</i>, followed by <i>i</i> with the sound of
<i>y</i> consonant; <i>fol-io</i> (<i>fol-yo</i>), <i>gen-ius</i> (<i>gen-yus</i>), <i>sav-ior</i>
(<i>sav-yor</i>).</p></div>

<p>Prefixes and suffixes are generally separated, <i>yel-low-ish</i>,
<i>eat-able</i>, <i>pre-lude</i>. This last word is sometimes pronounced
<i>prel-ude</i> and this pronunciation has some dictionary support,
but it is objectionable.</p>

<p>A consonant or digraph between two sounded vowels
usually joins the following vowel, <i>rea-son</i>, <i>no-ti-fy</i>, <i>mo-ther</i>.</p>

<p>When two or three consonants capable of beginning a
syllable come between two sounded vowels they may all be
joined to the following vowel.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>a</i>) When the preceding vowel is long and accented;
<i>en-a-bling</i>, <i>He-brew</i>, <i>i-dler</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) When the following vowel is an accented syllable;
<i>o-blige</i>, <i>re-dress</i>.</p></div>

<p>When two or three consonants capable of beginning a
syllable come between two sounded vowels one may be
joined to the preceding vowel.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>a</i>) When the vowel is short; <i>tab-let</i>, <i>res-cue</i>, <i>mus-ket</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>(<i>b</i>) When the consonants are <i>st</i>, <i>str</i>, or <i>sp</i>, if either
the preceding or following vowel is accented; <i>mis-tress</i>,
<i>aus-tere</i>, <i>oys-ter</i>, <i>sus-pect</i>.</p></div>

<p>When a consonant is doubled (not forming a digraph)
the two are generally separated; <i>beg-gar</i>, <i>bril-liant</i>, <i>cun-ning</i>.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned method of oral spelling by syllables
<i>m-a-s-mas-t-e-r-ter-master</i> will be found extremely useful in
teaching correct syllabication. It is recommended that
constant use be made of it in spelling drill.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="ACCENT" id="ACCENT"></a>ACCENT</h2>


<p>When a word consists of two syllables one of them
receives more stress of voice than the other. This stress
of voice is called accent. If the word consists of three or
more syllables there is usually another syllable stressed in
somewhat less degree. This is called a secondary accent.
In some cases there may even be a third accent if the word
is very long; <i>In'-come</i>, <i>val-e-tu'-di-na'-ri-an</i>. This fact arises
from the tendency natural to all human speech to take more
or less musical forms. The monotony of a series of
stressed or of unstressed sounds would be unbearable.
The pronunciation of such a series would be a highly artificial
and very difficult performance. Correct pronunciation
is very greatly concerned with the proper placing of
the accent. Indeed the meaning of a familiar word may
be quite obscured by a misplaced accent. For example,
<i>he-red'-it-ary</i> is a very familiar word, but when pronounced
<i>he-red-it'-ary</i>, as it was habitually by a friend of the author,
we have to stop and think before catching the meaning.</p>

<p>The placing of the accent in English is subject to two
general rules.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I The accent clings to the syllable which gives the
meaning to the word, or in technical terms, the root
syllable, <i>re-call'</i>, <i>in-stall'</i>, <i>in-stal-la'-tion</i> (accent falling
on the syllable which defines the word as a noun),
<i>in-her'-it</i>.</p>

<p>II Where the root syllable is not known the accent
falls on the first syllable, with secondary accents
following at intervals to relieve the voice.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>This last tendency not infrequently supersedes the other,
partly from the natural habit of the language, and partly
because the average man is not an etymologist and knows
very little about the derivation of the words he uses. For
example, in Shakespeare's time English people followed
the first rule and said <i>re-ven'-ue</i>, but now we say <i>rev'-e-nue</i>.</p>

<p>These two rules will serve as a good general guide to
accent. Attention should be paid to the pronunciation of
good speakers, and care taken to follow it. In case of
doubt the dictionary should be consulted and the proper
accent carefully fixed in the mind.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="DIVISION_OF_WORDS" id="DIVISION_OF_WORDS"></a>DIVISION OF WORDS</h2>


<p>When the words do not fit the line what shall we do?
The early printers used only one kind of spaces. In setting
a line of type they proceeded until there was no room in
the line for the next complete word of the copy. Then
they filled out the line with spaces and began the next word
on the next line. The length of the register being known
in advance and nothing but spaces being used in setting the
line, the compositor was spared much that makes composition
at once a hard labor and a fine art. The result was
an irregular margin at the right such as we now see in
typewritten letters.</p>

<p>With improvements in types and typography the squaring
out of the page soon came into fashion. In many cases
this can be done by the careful use of spaces so as to bring
a certain number of words squarely out to the end of the
line. There have been printers who have insisted that this
should always be done. Their efforts have not, however,
been successful. They result in a freakish looking page
with white spots in the lines where letters or words have
been spaced out to fill the register. It would be better, on
the whole, to resort to the practice of the old masters and
leave the right-hand margin irregular.</p>

<p>Ordinarily the difficulty has been met by dividing words
and putting a part of a word on one line and the rest of it
on another, indicating the break by a hyphen. The
hyphen in such a case is always the closing character in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>first line. Clearly this division must be so made as to assist
the reader in his task. The primary purpose of all printing
is to be read. Anything that adds to the legibility of the
printing improves it; anything that detracts from its legibility
harms it. How can we so divide words that the
legibility and intelligibility of the text will be maintained,
the line justified to register, and the beauty of the page
enhanced? These ends&mdash;legibility, intelligibility, and
beauty&mdash;are the aims of all the rules which have been
devised for the division of words. These are the things
the reader will see and by them he will judge the results.
He will probably know nothing about the rules by which
the compositor gains his results. The compositor needs
to know the rules, but to remember always that they are
only means by which to secure results.</p>

<p>There have been several attempts to devise systems of
division, but no one of them is thoroughly consistent or
universally adopted.</p>

<p>One system requires the division of a word when the
pronunciation will permit on the vowel at the end of the
syllable. It has the defect of making no provision for
syllables that end in consonants. Moreover, if rigorously
applied it would give us such divisions as <i>ca-pa-ci-ty</i>, <i>cata-stro-phe</i>,
<i>lexi-co-gra-pher</i>, <i>pre-fe-rence</i>, <i>pro-gno-sti-cate</i>, and
<i>re-co-gnize</i>.</p>

<p>Another system requires the division of consolidated
words at the junction of their elements, for example:</p>

<p class="words">
<i>magn-animous</i><br />
<i>cata-clysm</i><br />
<i>found-ation</i><br />
<i>oceano-graphy</i><br />
<i>theo-logy</i><br />
<i>know-ledge</i><br />
<i>lexi-co-grapher</i><br />
<i>in-fer-ence</i><br />
<i>pre-judice</i><br />

</p>

<p>In some cases this rule would lead to queer looking divisions.
More serious objections are that the system does
not provide for words that are long enough to be divided
but are yet not consolidated words, and, most of all, that
the average compositor is not an accomplished etymologist
and knows very little about the derivation, make up, and
compounding of the words he has to set up. He may be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>familiar, for example with the word <i>rheostat</i>, but it would
puzzle him to tell from what language it is derived, while
the word <i>enclave</i> would probably send him to the dictionary
for meaning as well as derivation, unless he happened to
be used to one particular kind of writing.</p>

<p>Another system, and probably on the whole the best
one, requires the division of the word on the accented
syllable.</p>

<p class="words">
<i>theol-ogy</i><br />
<i>catas-trophe</i><br />
<i>geog-raphy</i><br />
<i>lexi-cog-rapher</i><br />
<i>pref-erence</i><br />
<i>prog-nos-ticate</i><br />
</p>

<p>It will be noted that some of these examples show division
in more than one place, that is on the syllables which
bear either the primary or the secondary accent. This rule
does not provide for the cases when the division must come
on an unaccented syllable. The cases, however, when the
division cannot be made to come on either the syllable
bearing the primary accent or one bearing a secondary
accent will be comparatively few.</p>

<h2><a name="RULES_FOR_DIVISION_OF_WORDS" id="RULES_FOR_DIVISION_OF_WORDS"></a>RULES FOR DIVISION OF WORDS</h2>


<p>I The general rule, then, is to divide according to pronunciation,
not according to etymology or any hard and
fast rule.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As far as possible, consistently with pronunciation
and good spacing, divide according to meaning and
derivation, where known.</p>

<p><i>un-even</i>, not <i>une-ven</i>, <i>auto-mobile</i>, not <i>automo-bile</i>, <i>en-abled</i>,
not <i>ena-bled</i>.</p></div>

<p>II Divide on a vowel wherever practicable. In case a
vowel alone forms a syllable in the middle of a word it
should be run into the first line.</p>

<p class="words">
<i>busi-ness</i><br />
<i>sepa-rate</i><br />
<i>criti-cism</i><br />
<i>particu-lar</i><br />
<i>colo-nies</i><br />

<i>pro-duct</i><br />
<i>noi-sy</i><br />
<i>wo-man</i><br />
<i>pa-tron</i><br />
<i>me-moir</i><br />
</p>

<p>III When two consonants meet between vowels, and the
syllable ends on one consonant, the division may properly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>be made between the consonants, the pronunciation determining
the place of division.</p>

<p class="words">
<i>advan-tage</i><br />
<i>plain-tiff</i><br />
<i>Wil-liam</i><br />
<i>exces-sive</i><br />
<i>scur-rilous</i><br />
<i>mas-ter</i><br />
<i>gram-mar</i><br />
<i>profes-sor</i><br />
<i>moun-tain</i><br />
</p>

<p>IV When three consonants come together between
two vowels the first of which is short, the division comes
after the first consonant.</p>

<p class="words">
<i>han-dle</i><br />
<i>chil-dren</i><br />
<i>frus-trate</i><br />
</p>

<p>V A single consonant between two vowels should be
joined to the first vowel, if it is short; if the first vowel is
long the consonant goes with the second.</p>

<p class="words">
<i>riv-er</i><br />
<i>ri-val</i><br />
</p>

<p>VI Diphthongs should not be divided.</p>

<p class="words">

<p>VII Words compounded with a prefix should preferably
be divided on the prefix.</p>

</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Occasionally, however, the strong emphasis needed
for the <i>s</i> will call for a different arrangement, as in
<i>divis-ion</i>.</p></div>

<p>IX The terminations <i>-ing</i>, <i>-en</i>, <i>-ed</i>, <i>-er</i>, <i>-est</i>, and the plural
<i>-es</i> go over to the next line except when the preceding
consonant is doubled, or when they follow <i>c</i> or <i>g</i> soft.</p>

<p class="words">

<p>XI Adjectives in <i>ical</i> divide on the <i>i</i>.</p>

<p class="words">
<i>physi-cal</i><br />
<i>inimi-cal</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>XII In derivatives of words ending in <i>-t</i>, the division
follows the accent.</p>

<p><i>objec-tion</i>, not <i>object-ion</i>, <i>defec-tion</i>, not <i>defect-ion</i>, but
<i>respec-tively</i>, not <i>respect-ively</i> and <i>distinc-tion</i>, not <i>distinct-ion</i>.</p>

<p>XIII Never separate <i>c</i> and <i>g</i> from the vowels <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, and
<i>y</i> upon which their soft sound depends.</p>

<p class="words">
<i>re-li-gion</i><br />
<i>ca-pa-ci-ty</i><br />
</p>

<p>XIV Never separate <i>q</i> from <i>u</i>, <i>qu</i> is a single sound.</p>

<p>XV Do not divide <i>nothing</i>.</p>

<p>XVI Do not divide words of four letters.</p>

<p>XVII Do not divide words of five or six letters if it can
be avoided. Good spacing, however, must be considered
of first importance.</p>

<p>XVIII In wide measures (20 ems or more) do not divide
so as to end or begin a line with a syllable of two letters. Here
again, however, good spacing is the first consideration.</p>

<p>XIX Do not divide words of two syllables pronounced
as one, including past participles of short words.</p>

<p class="words">
<i>heaven</i><br />
<i>power</i><br />
<i>prayer</i><br />

possible.</p>

<p>XXI Do not separate a divisional mark (<i>a</i>), (<i>1</i>) from
the matter to which it pertains.</p>

<p>XXII Do not divide an amount stated in figures.</p>

<p>XXIII Do not divide proper names, especially those of
persons, if it can be avoided.</p>

<p>XXIV Do not divide initials or such combinations as
<i>a.m.</i>, <i>B.C.</i></p>

<p>XXV Do not divide the last word on a page so as to
carry a part of it to the next page.</p>

<p>XXVI Do not divide the last word of the last full line
of a paragraph.</p>

<p>XXVII More than two divisions in successive lines
should be avoided.</p>

<p>XXVIII Never divide at all if you can help it.</p>

<h2><a name="IMPORTANCE_OF_SPACING" id="IMPORTANCE_OF_SPACING"></a>IMPORTANCE OF SPACING</h2>


<p>It must always be remembered that good spacing is the
first consideration. Nothing is more offensive to the eye
of a good judge of printing than bad spacing. &#8220;Rivers&#8221; of
white, dark spots, crowded black text, are very serious
blemishes to a page. An ordinary book page is a study in
color, the colors employed being black and white. Proper
combination, balance, and proportion are as important here
as in places where a variety of colors is employed. Many
of the foregoing rules must be held subject to the exigencies
of proper spacing. A rigid adherence, for example, to the
rule that not more than two consecutive lines should end
with divided words will not justify a badly spaced, unsightly
line. There are many things that look worse than a hyphen
at the end of the last full line in a paragraph. Avoidance
of dividing the last word on a page, however, would justify
even bad spacing, because of the gain to the reader. In
the last resort, the interests of the reader must always have
first consideration.</p>

<p>Division is greatly affected by the length of the measure.
A long measure, 18 or 20 ems or more, gives greater
opportunity for arranging the spacing, but, on the other
hand, makes division on short syllables conspicuous and
out of proportion. Very short register, as in two-column
Bibles or in cases where illustrations are inserted in the
text, presents very great difficulties and often calls for
division which would not be allowable elsewhere. Such
cases often call for the exercise of the greatest care and
ingenuity.</p>

<p>It often happens that the author can be of great assistance
to the printer in making a handsome page. A change of
a phrase, or even of a word will avoid a difficulty which
cannot be avoided by a printer except at the cost of bad
division or bad spacing. If the author is a sensible person
he will gladly cooperate with the printer in giving his
thoughts clothing appropriate to their intrinsic beauty and
value. After the printer has exhausted his resources he
should not hesitate to carry his troubles to the author.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="DIVISION_IN_LINES_OF_DISPLAY" id="DIVISION_IN_LINES_OF_DISPLAY"></a>DIVISION IN LINES OF DISPLAY</h2>


<p>As a rule division is never used in lines of display. In
these cases the display is the important thing. Every word
long enough to be divided is important enough to be displayed
and emphasized. Divided words are weakened
words. Lines of irregular lengths are used of set purpose.</p>

<p>In title pages words of bold display must never be divided.
In minor lines of display, such as subtitles and summaries,
words are often divided. A subheading of two
lines should never be divided in the first line when it is
possible to turn the full word over on to the next line. The
shortening of the first line is never a blemish, but a too
short second line following a hyphened first line is always
a fault.</p>

<p>There is a school of ultra-artistic composition in book
titles which affects a solid squaring up and hesitates at no
means to secure its effects. It sets a definite measure and
forces the lines into it, dividing words arbitrarily and using
no hyphen. This is a passing fancy and will pass as
eccentricities always pass. It should not be used unless
the author insists upon it. The man who pays the bills
has a right to have his work done as he pleases. The
intelligent printer, however, will not allow the peculiarities
of the individual customer to affect his general practice.</p>

FOR APPRENTICES</h2>


<p>The following list of publications, comprising the <span class="smcap">Typographic
Technical Series for Apprentices</span>, has been prepared
under the supervision of the Committee on Education of the
United Typothetae of America for use in trade classes, in course of
printing instruction, and by individuals.</p>

<p>Each publication has been compiled by a competent author or
group of authors, and carefully edited, the purpose being to provide
the printers of the United States&mdash;employers, journeymen,
and apprentices&mdash;with a comprehensive series of handy and
inexpensive compendiums of reliable, up-to-date information upon
the various branches and specialties of the printing craft, all
arranged in orderly fashion for progressive study.</p>

<p>The publications of the series are of uniform size, 5&times;8 inches.
Their general make-up, in typography, illustrations, etc., has
been, as far as practicable, kept in harmony throughout. A brief
synopsis of the particular contents and other chief features of each
volume will be found under each title in the following list.</p>

<p>Each topic is treated in a concise manner, the aim being to
embody in each publication as completely as possible all the
rudimentary information and essential facts necessary to an understanding
of the subject. Care has been taken to make all statements
accurate and clear, with the purpose of bringing essential
information within the understanding of beginners in the different
fields of study. Wherever practicable, simple and well-defined
drawings and illustrations have been used to assist in giving
additional clearness to the text.</p>

<p>In order that the pamphlets may be of the greatest possible
help for use in trade-school classes and for self-instruction, each
title is accompanied by a list of Review Questions covering
essential items of the subject matter. A short Glossary of technical
terms belonging to the subject or department treated is also
added to many of the books.</p>

<p>These are the Official Text-books of the United Typothetae of
America.</p>

<h2><a name="ACKNOWLEDGMENT" id="ACKNOWLEDGMENT"></a>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</h2>


<p>This series of Typographic Text-books is the result of the
splendid co-operation of a large number of firms and individuals
engaged in the printing business and its allied industries
in the United States of America.</p>

<p>The Committee on Education of the United Typothetae of
America, under whose auspices the books have been prepared and
published, acknowledges its indebtedness for the generous assistance
rendered by the many authors, printers, and others identified
with this work.</p>

<p>While due acknowledgment is made on the title and copyright
pages of those contributing to each book, the Committee nevertheless
felt that a group list of co-operating firms would be of
interest.</p>

<p>The following list is not complete, as it includes only those who
have co-operated in the production of a portion of the volumes,
constituting the first printing. As soon as the entire list of books
comprising the Typographic Technical Series has been completed
(which the Committee hopes will be at an early date), the full list
will be printed in each volume.</p>

<p>The Committee also desires to acknowledge its indebtedness to
the many subscribers to this Series who have patiently awaited its
publication.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
